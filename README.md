# ClojureBVE (OpenBVE Clone in Clojure)

http://www.openbve.org/

The main motivation for this project is for me to learn OpenGL and
sharpen up my clojure skills. Use it with caution.

## New Features

* Multiplayer (Pending)
* Dispatch Display (Pending)
* Drive on Any Rail (Pending)

## Current Status

Most of the core features are in progress and the game is nearly
playable. However, the app isn't really packaged for use yet.

Major Pieces Left:
* Brakes
* Command Line Interface
* Texture Clamping
* Render more overlays
* Arcade-style points
* Fix texture flipping
* Switch to quad-trees instead of sphere-based fulcrum culling

Right now only simple routes work (max 1M vertexes for 30fps running)
and only *panel.cfg* simple cabs work
